## Instructions
1. Click on one of the three buttons. The computer will generate a random response to your choice.
2. Continue clicking to your heart's content to see if you can beat the computer.
3. When you're finished, click the button labelled "Click Me" to see the final score.
4. If so inclined, click the button labelled "Play again?" to start a new game.
 
## Summary
This app is built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript and was a lot of fun to make. It gave me plenty of experience working with eventListeners and the DOM. It was also a lot of fun implementing the feedback my instructor and mentor, Andy Sterkowitz, provided via his code review. So much can be done with so little if you know how to leverage the power of the given language.

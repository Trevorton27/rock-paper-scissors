##Summary
This app is built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript and was a lot of fun to make. It gave me plenty of experience working with eventListeners and the DOM. It was also a lot of fun implementing the feedback my instructor and mentor, Andy Sterkowitz, provided via his code review. So much can be done with so little if you know how to leverage the power of the given language.
